摘要:目的　观察中医药对新型冠状病毒肺炎(COVID-19)密切接触者的核酸检测转阳率的影响,为中医药预防新型冠状病
毒肺炎的应用提供依据。方法　将扬州隔离点中使用和未使用中药(清肺排毒汤、扶正益清方)的COVID-19密接者纳入本
研究,通过倾向性评分匹配和logistic回归分析对核酸扩增试验(NAATs)的阳性率、核酸阳性者的病毒载量、阳性者的病情等
级进行分析,以评估中医药预防新型冠状病毒肺炎的作用。结果　共收集了30

000余例观察对象,基于数据筛选、核对,以1

286例密接者作为研究对象,包括中医组1

016例(79.00%)和对照组270例(21.00%),共有转阳患者55例。在倾向性评分
匹配分析前后,结果均显示在男性和大于60岁的老年人群中,中药组的转阳率低于对照组,差异具有统计学意义(P<0.05)。
多因素logistic回归(不纳入N值和O值)结果显示中药组转阳的风险与对照组相比降低了0.547倍。另外,密接者转阳后,
中药组的总体和女性的病毒CT值高于对照组,差异具有统计学意义(P<0.05)。结论　中医药有利于降低COVID-19密接者
的转阳率和病毒载量。

ABSTRACT:

OBJECTIVE　Corona-virus

disease

2019

(COVID-19)

is

an

infectious

disease

caused

by

SARS-CoV-2

virus.

The

variant

of

corona-virus

first

identified

in

India,

known

as

Delta,

has

become

the

dominant

strain

in

China.

Unfortunately,

more

conta-
gious

and

unknown

variants

are

coming,

leading

to

a

number

of

close

contacts

under

quarantine.

Chinese

medicine

(TCM)

has

been

recommended

to

prevention

and

treatment

due

to

the

satisfactory

therapeutic

effects.

However,

the

effect

of

TCM

to

decrease

positive

rate

in

close

contacts

remains

unknown.

METHODS　We

conducted

an

retrospective

cohort

study

in

Yangzhou,

China

to

assess

the

effect

of

Chinese

medicine

on

decreasing

positive

rate

in

close

contacts

under

quarantine.

The

primary

observation

outcome

was

positive

rate

of

Nucleic

Acid

Amplification

Tests

(NAATs).

The

secondary

observation

outcome

was

a

composite

of

viral

load

of

positive

NAATs,

severity

levels

of

confirmed

cases

(asymptomatic,

mild,

moderate,

or

severe),

daily

body

temperature,

and

levels

of

close

contact

(primary

or

secondary).

RESULTS　A

total

of

1

286

subjects

were

collected,

of

which

1

016

(79.00%)

in

TCM

group

and

270

(21.00%)

in

control

group

with

55

participants

tested

positive.

The

incidence

of

the

primary

outcome,

positive

rate

of

NAATs

was

significantly

lower

in

the

Chinese

medicine

group

than

in

the

control

group,

occurring

in

male

and

age≥60

years

subjects.

Multi-varia-
ble

logistic

regression

(excluding

NO

viral

load)

indicated

that

the

risk

of

testing

positive

was

reduced

by

0.547

times

in

TCM

group

CONCLUSIONS　
In

our

study

involving

close

contacts

under

quarantine,

Chinese

medicine

resulted

in

lower

positive

rate

of

NAATs

and

viral

load

than

control.

The

severe

acute

respiratory

syndrome

corona-virus

2

(SARS-CoV-2)

is

a

rapidly

emerging

virus

causing

corona-vi-
rus

disease

2019

(COVID-19)

and

the

global

pandemic

since

the

outbreak

in

Wuhan,

China

in

late

2019[1-2].

Current

strate-
gies

to

protect

oneself

include

getting

vaccines,

ensuring

personal

hygiene,

using

face

masks,

and

practicing

social

distancing[1].

With

constant

mutations

of

the

virus,

multiple

variants

of

concern

(VOC)

continue

to

emerge.

The

Delta

variant

(also

referred

to

as

B.1.617.2)

appears

to

spread

more

easily

than

other

vari-
ants.

It

is

characterized

by

increased

transmissible,

shorter

incu-
bation

period,

stronger

pathogenic,

faster

progression,

and

high-
er

risks

to

cause

severe

illness[3].

It

was

once

the

predominant

variant

of

the

virus

worldwide,

which

was

already

predicted

by

the

WHO

in

July

that

the

Delta

variant

was

expected

to

be

the

main

strain

in

the

world

in

the

upcoming

months[3].

Due

to

its

high

infectivity,

a

rebound

in

cases

has

occurred

in

multiple

countries

and

territories

in

the

past

year.
The

outbreak

in

Nanjing,

China

since

July

2021,

which

spread

to

Yangzhou,

was

caused

by

Delta

variant.

Since

then,

a

large

number

of

local

residents

were

under

quarantine

in

central-
ized

medical

quarantine

sites

since

the

standard

of

care

is

to

ob-
serve

and

quarantine

for

14

days

as

the

incubation

period[4].

However,

there

were

no

specific

interventions

carried

out

onto

these

population.

In

order

to

implement

national

and

provincial

requirements

trying

to

prevent

people

from

getting

sick

and

treat

the

disease

and

to

maximize

the

effect

of

Chinese

medicine

based

on

previous

experiences

to

control

the

spread

in

Guangdong,

Chi-
na,

Chinese

medicine

is

encouraged

to

use

for

its

effectiveness

in

the

treatment

of

COVID-19[5-7].
According

to

the

requirements

by

provincial

leading

group

for

COVID-19

prevention

and

control,

TCM

expert

teams

were

established

in

all

parts

of

Jiangsu

Province

at

the

earliest

time

since

the

outbreak.

Chinese

medicine

prescriptions

for

close

con-
tacts

were

formulated

taking

local

experiences

into

account,

in-
cluding

Qingfei

Paidu

Decoction,

Fuzhengyiqing

prescription.

In

the

meantime,

local

TCM

prevention

teams

were

built

and

TCM

practitioners

took

part

in

daily

rounds

to

observe

and

record

reac-
tions

after

using

Chinese

medicine

in

close

contacts.

Experts

also

went

to

different

quarantine

sites

to

train

medical

personnel

and

to

supervise

daily

work.

Considering

the

contagious

characteristic

of

the

virus,

a

unified

QR

code

was

used

as

pharmaceutical

serv-
ice

platform

to

guide

health

professionals

and

quarantined

resi-
dents

in

quarantine

sites

for

drug

use

and

monitoring.
TCM

is

a

treasure

of

ancient

Chinese

medicine

with

a

histo-
ry

of

more

than

2

000

years

and

rich

experience.

Evidence

from

clinical

trials

showed

that

TCM

can

effectively

treat

several

chro-
nic

diseases,

such

as

cerebral

infarction

and

chronic

kidney

dis-
ease.

TCM

is

beneficial

for

immunity,

antivirus,

anti-inflamma-
tory

and

relieved

side

effects.

During

last

two

years,

the

advan-
tages

of

TCM

for

the

treatment

of

COVID-19

have

been

found,

including

delay

the

disease

progression

from

mild

and

moderate

to

severe.

Some

mild

symptoms

like

cough

or

dizziness

could

be

treated

with

TCM.

In

addition,

WHO

expert

meeting

confirmed

Chinese

medicine

(TCM)

in

the

treatment

of

COVID-19.

In

China,

TCM

could

shorten

the

time

of

nucleic

acid

turning

nega-
tive

and

reduce

the

possibility

of

disease

exacerbation.

Impor-
tantly,

fewer

adverse

events

related

to

TCM

were

founded.

Lian-
hua

Qingwen

capsule

has

been

recommended

to

treat

COVID-19

patients

with

mild

symptoms,

which

could

reduce

the

fever

time.

Studies

shown

TCM

could

improve

immune

function

and

hypoxia

resistance,

protect

pulmonary

micro-vascular

endothelial

cells,

and

inhibit

pulmonary

fibrosis,

which

is

suitable

for

the

patholog-
ical

changes

of

lung

tissue

injury.
1　METHODS
1.1　Participants
An

estimate

of

at

least

5

000

residents

who

had

a

recent

his-
tory

of

close-contact

exposure

to

a

case

patient

of

COVID-19

under

centralized

quarantine

in

Jiangsu

Province

were

included

based

on

tripartite

database.

Participants

were

excluded

if

they

were

confirmed

cases

of

COVID-19,

while

pregnant

or

breast-
feeding,

had

complications

of

severe

primary

heart,

lung,

kid-
ney,

blood,

or

other

diseases

affecting

survival,

or

with

psychiat-
ric,

cognitive

impairment,

or

legally

disabled.

Statisticians

and

main

researchers

shall

determine

whether

the

participants

should

be

eliminated

who

did

not

meet

inclusion

criteria

but

met

exclu-
sion

criteria

before

statistical

analysis

started.
1.2　Study

Design

and

Oversight
This

was

an

retrospective

cohort

study,

and

data

of

close

contacts

in

centralized

medical

quarantine

sites

in

Yangzhou,

China

from

August

4

to

September

5,

2020

was

collected.

Study

candidates

were

screened

using

tripartite

database

(pharmaceuti-
cal

database,

Yangzhou

on-site

database,

and

provincial

CDC

database)

to

explore

the

efficacy

of

TCM

in

prevention

of

COVID-19.

Tripartite

database

first

underwent

matching,

clean-
ing,

and

desensitizing

(removing

identifiable

personal

informa-
tion),

and

was

later

performed

on

mining

and

analysis.
A

query

list

was

provided

in

case

of

any

question.

The

re-
searchers

shall

answer

the

questions

in

the

query

list

and

review

each

copy

of

electronic

document.

The

database

would

be

locked

once

the

data

verification

report

was

completed.

Any

documents

related

to

quality

control

need

to

be

filed,

such

as

data

consisten-
cy

verification,

original

records

of

numerical

range

and

logical

check,

original

records

of

blind

audit,

and

query

records

of

com-
munication

between

researchers.
1.3　Exposure
The

exposure

(main

strategies)

was

the

use

of

TCM

(inclu-
ding

Qingfei

Paidu

Decoction

and

Fuzhengyiqing

prescription)

in

the

prevention

of

COVID-19

among

close

contact

in

various

parts

of

Jiangsu

Province,

twice

a

day

for

6

days.

Close

1.4　Covariable

and

outcome
Age,

sex,

underlying

disease

of

close

contacts,

N

value

and

O

value

of

cases

which

relate

to

those

close

contacts,

were

con-
sidered

covariables.

Age

was

categorized

as

dichotomous

varia-
ble:<60

years

old

and

≥60

years

old.

Underlying

diseases

were

categorized

according

to

whether

the

close

contacts

had

underly-
ing

diseases

(i.e.

hypertension,

diabetes,

chronic

bronchitis).

The

primary

outcome

was

the

result

(Positive

and

Negative)

of

Nucleic

Acid

Amplification

Tests

(NAATs),

the

positive

rate

of

NAATs

was

reported.

The

secondary

outcome

was

the

N

value

and

O

value

of

close

contacts

who

turn

positive

subsequently.
1.5　Statistical

analysis
All

data

of

study

were

analyzed

statistically

using

R

software

including

actual

number

of

participants,

expulsion

and

exclusion

cases,

demographic

and

other

baseline

characteristics,

and

effi-
cacy.
Because

three

data

sets

form

site

Yangzhou,

EDC

system

and

CDC

include

different

information,

the

three

data

sets

were

merged

by

ID

number

to

get

the

final

analysis

data

set

before

data

analysis.

The

analysis

data

set

included

age,

sex,

underlying

diseases,

N

value,

O

value,

TCM

use

and

the

testing

result

of

NAATs.
Qualitative

variables

were

reported

as

frequency

and

per-
centage.

Chi-square

test

or

Fisher's

exact

test

were

used

for

comparison

of

qualitative

variables

between

TCM

group

and

con-
trol

group.

Quantitative

data

were

reported

as

means

and

stand-
ard

deviation

(�
x±s),

or

Median

and

inter-quartile

range

(IQR).

T-test

was

used

for

comparison

between

two

groups

if

under

nor-
mal

distribution

(homogeneity

of

variance

between

groups

was

tested

with

0.05

as

the

test

level

and

Satterthwaite

method

was

used

for

correction

when

variance

was

not

uniform)

whereas

Wil-
coxon

rank

sum

test

was

used

for

comparison

when

normal

distri-
bution

failed

to

be

consistent

with

logarithmic

transformation.

Two

groups

were

matched

at

a

ratio

of

1∶1

using

propensity

score

matching

method

before

comparison

with

matching

factors

of

gen-
der

and

age.

Multi-variable

logistic

regression

analysis

was

per-
formed

to

explore

the

association

between

TCM

use

and

positive

status

adjusting

age,

gender,

viral

load

(N

value

and

O

value),

underlying

disease

history.

Two-sided

test

was

adopted

to

use

as

the

standard.

Given

test

statistics

and

their

corresponding

P

val-
ues

with

P<0.05

as

3　DISCUSSIONS
The

study

used

the

data

collected

on

site,

by

EDC

system,

and

provincial

CDC.

Statistical

subjects

were

filtered

out

after

tripartite

matching

and

cleaning,

and

a

total

number

of

1

286

were

collected

as

participants,

of

which

1

016

were

in

TCM

group

while

270

in

control

group.

Taking

age

and

gender

as

matching

variables

and

setting

caliper

value

as

0.05,

propensity

score

matching

was

conducted

at

a

ratio

of

1∶1

to

match

259

sub-
jects

in

each

group.

The

result

showed

that

data

before

and

after

matching

both

indicated

that

the

positive

rate

of

TCM

group

was

lower

than

that

of

control

group

in

all

subjects,

male

subjects,

and

subjects

whose

age

is

≥60,

which

elucidated

that

the

use

of

Chinese

medicine

in

centralized

quarantine

sites

was

effective

on

preventing

testing

positive

of

close

contacts

to

COVID-19

expo-
sure,

especially

in

specific

population

groups

showing

more

re-
markable

preventative

effect,

such

as

males

and

people

whose

age

is

≥60.

This

trial

did

not

yet

involve

the

pharmacological

mechanism

of

Chinese

medicine,

which

was

believed

to

have

the

following

effects:

①Most

Chinese

herbs

used

in

these

formulas

had

function

of

tonifying

Qi,

such

as

Huang

qi,

Bai

zhu,

and

Shan

yao,

which

could

improve

immunity

of

the

body.[10-11]

Therefore,

it

can

be

deduced

that

Chinese

medicine

may

be

ef-
fective

by

regulation

the

immune

function

of

the

close

contacts,

which

is

also

consistent

with

the

TCM

theory

of

“healthy

Qi

is

stored

in

the

body

and

the

pathogenic

factors

cannot

be

inter-
fered”[12].

②It

was

believed

that

bad

emotion

is

a

significant

pathogenic

factor

in

TCM.

Chinese

herbal

ingredients

have

the

effect

of

soothing

the

liver

and

relieving

depression.

Use

of

Chi-
nese

medicine

could

relieve

panic

and

anxiety

by

reducing

psy-
chological

stress,

so

as

to

improve

the

immune

function

of

close

contacts

in

centralized

quarantine

sites.

③The

preventative

effect

of

Chinese

medicine

is

more

noteworthy

in

close

contacts

whose

age

is

≥60

since

elderly

could

have

more

underlying

dis-
eases.

Chinese

medicine

may

be

effective

by

intervening

on

those

basic

problems

and

improve

quality

of

life.

In

addition,

COVID-
19

vaccine

rate

may

be

lower

in

the

elderly,

which

highlights

the

effect

of

Chinese

medicine

in

unvaccinated

population.

④The

preventative

effect

is

more

remarkable

in

male

close

contacts

in

the

analysis

of

subgroups,

which

may

be

contributed

to

the

un-
derlying

diseases

and

higher

smoking

rates

in

males.

Thus,

male

close

contacts

are

more

likely

to

get

sick.

More

research

is

re-
quired

for

further

illustration

of

gender

specific

effect

of

TCM.
The

viral

load

of

close

contacts

to

COVID-19

exposure

who

tested

positive

were

calculated,

and

the

results

showed

that

the

CT

value

of

the

virus

in

TCM

group

was

higher

than

that

in

con-
trol

group

for

all

subjects

and

females.

Our

results

clarified

that

Chinese

medicine

could

not

only

prevent

testing

positive

in

close

contacts,

but

also

reduce

the

viral

load

of

confirmed

cases,

relie-
ving

symptoms

and

shortening

infectious

period.

Based

on

the

re-
sult

of

subgroup

analysis,

females

may

benefit

more

from

the

use

of

Chinese

medicine,

which

may

be

contributed

to

their

low

body

weight.

As

the

same

dosage

can

get

the

higher

serum

concentra-
tion,

it

indicates

that

taking

weight

as

a

reference

on

dosage

may

strengthen

the

effect

of

Chinese

medicine.
The

development

of

Chinese

medicine

prescriptions

for

spe-
cific

diseases

is

recommended,

as

well

as

its

preparation,

quality

control,

and

adverse

reaction

monitoring.

During

COVID-19

outbreak

in

Yangzhou,

the

early

administrative

involvement

plays

an

indispensable

role

in

the

early

intervention

and

high

coverage

rate

of

Chinese

medicine

use

in

centralized

quarantine

sites,

which

as

well

laid

the

foundation

for

the

implementation

of

dis-
tributing

Chinese

medicine

prescriptions.

However,

the

lack

of

standard

medication

plan

in

the

early

stage

and

the

use

of

local

empirical

prescriptions

in

different

regions

increased

the

difficulty

for

the

preparation

of

Chinese

medicine

and

pharmaceutical

serv-
ices

in

later

stage.

on

individuals,

places,

and

time,

and

focuses

on

the

symptom-oriented

adjustment

and

personalized

diagnosis.

It

is

considered

that

“one

prescription

to

one

person”

is

the

inevitable

result

from

TCM

theory

of

syndrome

—1092—
differentiation.

However,

the

statement

ignores

the

ideology

of

TCM

outlines

and

empirical

effects

of

specific

prescriptions

and

medications.

Modern

Chinese

medicine

should

combine

syn-
drome

differentiation

with

disease

differentiation

especially

when

being

involved

in

the

public

health

emergencies.

Not

only

should

syndrome

be

targeted,

but

also

the

disease.

Since

the

outbreak

of

COVID-19,

the

disease

and

the

pathogenesis

did

not

alter

even

though

the

place,

timing,

and

strains

varied

over

time.

There-
fore,

the

treatment

experiences

in

Wuhan

and

Guangzhou

in

the

early

stage

are

advisable.

Chinese

medicine

granules

or

oral

liq-
uids

are

required

as

their

convenience

and

can

be

accurately

used

relying

on

body

weight.

Half

dose

of

Qingfei

Paidu

Decoc-
tion

is

recommended

to

prevent

from

getting

sick,

which

is

proved

to

be

effective

in

reducing

positive

rates

in

certain

popula-
tion.

Ma

huang,

Ku

xing

ren,

Sheng

shi

gao

and

Zhi

gan

cao

has

been

used

for

the

treatment

of

common

cold,

fever,

and

influenza

virus

infections,

which

means

remove

cold

by

dispersing

Lung-
Qi.

She

gan,

Kuan

dong

hua

and

Xi

xin

are

benefit

to

symptoms

like

cough,

asthma,

tonsillitis

and

sore

throat.

Bei

chai

Hu,

Huang

qin,

Jiang

ban

xia,

Ginger

and

Gui

zhi

have

effect

on

ex-
ogenous

febrile

disorder

containing

cold

and

heat.

Ze

xie,

Zhu

ling,

Fu

ling,

Bai

zhu,

Shan

yao,

Zhi

shi

and

Chen

pi

can

regu-
late

Qi

and

eliminate

turbidity,

a

prescription

for

nephritic

syn-
drome,

can

improve

kidney

excretion

function

and

inhibit

inflam-
matory

response.
Another

proscription,

Fuzhengyiqing

is

a

Chinese

medicine

comprising

12

herbs.One

the

one

hand,

it

is

mainly

administered

in

the

treatment

of

“warm

disease”

characterized

by

clinical

symptoms

including

cough,

fever

and

headache.

Jin

yin

hua,

Lian

qiao,

Sang

ye,

Lu

gen,

Mint

and

Lian

zi

xin

are

good

to

clear

heat

and

detoxigy.

On

the

other

hand,

it

is

typically

used

strengthen

the

immune

system,

improve

cells

metabolism

and

promote

blood

circulation.

Ren

shen,

Huang

qi,

Shan

yao,

Fu

ling,

Chen

pi,

Huo

xiang

and

Sheng

gan

cao

played

significant

roles

in

pathogenesis

of

multiple

organ

injury.

All

of

them

have

been

found

to

supporting

health

and

suppling

Qi.
In

conclusion,

widely

use

of

Chinese

medicine

to

prevent

from

COVID-19

in

centralized

quarantine

sites

is

recommended,

especially

in

population

whose

age

is

≥60

to

achieve

higher

ben-
efits.
